# Draw-Shape-in-Java

  This Java program draws a shape based on the user's selection of shape type: line, parabola, or circle. The user is prompted to input the necessary coefficients or coordinates, and the program outputs the corresponding shape on the console using asterisks and various symbols for axes and labels. The program also includes an option for the user to exit the program. The program uses loops and conditional statements to generate the shapes, and a Scanner object to read user input.
